          <h1>Profile</h1>

          <p class="lead">
            I'm a Software Engineer currently working
            on <a href="http://www.circlestreet.com">Circle Street</a>,
            a Valassis Digital Media property. I have an eclectic
            background, with work in the UK Prison Service which
            alongside application development, application and security
            architecture, security technology research, training in
            moral, political and natural philosophy, and a USPA
            skydiving license, all contribute to my unique perspective
            on software engineering and network security. I have 15
            years of experience in a range of technology roles, and am
            always keen to work with new technology. I am a programming
            language nerd as time allows, but am also happy in the
            infrastructure, automating deployments or doing performance
            analysis. I enjoy working both in tight-knit teams and
            alone. I favour agile development projects, continuous
            integration and frequent deployments for fun and risk
            mitigation.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            I am particularly interested in expanding my reach into Big
            Data projects, commercial or otherwise, and finding an
            opportunity to write in Clojure.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am authorized to work in Canada and the EU. I am not
            currently authorized to work in the US, but have been in the
            past.

            <h3>Software Engineer, Sun Microsystems of Canada - 2007-2009</h3>

            <p>
              Java Programmer on the OMalley project, aka Sun Software
              Library. OMalley was an agile development project building a
              web 2.0 community and marketplace for Sun's partners and
              customers. It used a technology stack based on Solaris 10,
              MySQL and the Glassfish application server, and leveraged
              Hibernate (ORM), Spring (IoC, TX management), Velocity
              (templating), Lucene (searching and indexing) and Quartz
              (scheduling) frameworks. My work was in the server
              components of the system. During my time on the OMalley
              project, I developed prototypes using Ruby on Rails, and
              components using Jersey (which implements Java extensions
              for RESTful Web Services, aka JAX-RS).

          <p>
            I have extensive experience specializing in <b>UNIX</b> and
            UNIX-like operating systems, including many <b>Linux</b>
            distributions (starting with <b>Slackware</b> 2.0, moving
            to <b>Red Hat</b>, <b>SuSE</b>, <b>Fedora</b>, <b>Gentoo</b>,
            <b>Debian</b> and <b>Ubuntu</b>), <b>Solaris</b> (starting
            with 2.5.1), <b>OpenBSD</b>, and my current desktop, <b>Mac
              OS X</b>. I have a good understanding of and practical
            experience with <b>Solaris 10</b>,
            <b>Solaris 11</b> security. I have managed production
            systems using <b>Puppet</b> including a deployment of around
            140 OpenSolaris hosts running an array of diverse products
            and applications including <b>Sun Directory Server
              Enterprise Edition</b>, <b>Glassfish</b>, <b>Apache</b>
            and <b>Sun Java System Instant Messaging Server</b>. Most
            recently I have been using the <b>PaaS</b>
            provider <b>Heroku</b> supported by their many wonderful
            "addons", along with <b>Amazon Web Services'</b> <b>S3</b>
            service and <b>EC2</b> for some aspects of development and
            performance testing.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am well versed with the use of many open source security
            tools of the types listed
            at <a href="http://insecure.org/tools.html">insecure.org</a>
            and am skilled and experienced in the reading of packet
            dumps and other <b>Network Security Monitoring</b> activities.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am an accomplished programmer having produced applications
            written mostly in <b>Java</b>, <b>Ruby</b>, <b>Javascript</b>
            (or <b>CoffeeScript</b>) and <b>Perl</b>. I have improvised
            in many languages however, including <b>C</b> and
            <b>Python</b>. My web application development work has
            involved <b>HTML 4</b> and <b>5</b>, <b>CSS3</b>,
            <b>SCSS/SASS/LESS</b> and a lot of <b>jQuery</b>. I have
            been pursuing personal projects in <b>Clojure</b> when the
            opportunity arises, and am an aspiring polyglot; new
            language skills are quickly acquired.
          </p>

          <p>
            Previous <b>Java</b> programming roles have led me to acquire
            expertise in a number of enterprise class frameworks such as
            <b>Hibernate</b> (natively, and also as a <b>J2EE</b> entity
            manager implementation, using vanilla <b>JPA</b>),
            <b>Spring</b>, <b>Jersey</b> (<b>JAX-RS</b>
            implementation), <b>Lucene</b>, <b>Velocity</b>
            and <b>Quartz</b>. Most recently I have been working
            on <b>Ruby on a Rails</b> and <b>Node.js</b> applications
            backed by both relational (<b>MySQL</b>
            and <b>PostgreSQL</b>) and <b>NoSQL</b> (<b>MongoDB</b>)
            databases. I have made use of <b>RSpec</b>
            and <b>Cucumber</b> for <b>behaviour driven design</b> in
            Ruby, <b>Mocha</b> and <b>Jasmine</b> for Javascript/Node;
            for performance testing I have been using <b>Apache
            JMeter</b>. I much prefer <b>agile development</b> as a
            methodology and a style, and advocate strongly
            particularly for <b>test driven design</b>, <b>continuous
            testing and integration</b>, and <b>frequent production
            deployments</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I tend to favour <b>Emacs</b> as my primary IDE, though I
            have experience with a variety of tools
            including <b>NetBeans</b> and <b>Eclipse</b> IDEs for
            development; <b>Maven</b>, <b>Ant</b>, <b>Rake</b> and
            <b>Capistrano</b> for build lifecycle control; <b>Hudson</b>
            and <b>Tddium</b> for continuous integration; <b>Git</b> and
            previously <b>Subversion</b> for source code management.
          </p>

          <p>
            Last but not least, my presentation and communication skills
            are excellent; I have made numerous presentations as a part
            of my work, and have presented and facilitated at software
            conferences; in previous roles I have provided ad hoc and
            formal training to Sun partners in the use of <b>DTrace</b>
            and to non-technical end-users in the use of newly deployed
            applications.
